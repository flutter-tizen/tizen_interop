# tizen_interop_callbacks_example

Demonstrates how to use the tizen_interop_callbacks plugin.

## Getting Started

The application shows status of battery - if charger is connected and battery level.
The status is only shown when a callback information about change is called.

Not every Tizen device supports battery. You can run the example on emulator and use
the Control Panel to simulate changes in charger/battery status.
